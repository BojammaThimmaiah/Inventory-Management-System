# Inventory-Management-System
This repository is having all the codes used in Python for AIML internship by Elite Techno Groups.

In Adding values file - I have read the products which was present in original record.json file.
Imported json and added 25 extra items with 5 attributes each making total of 31 items with 5 attributes each.
To add more items to the dictonary i have used the while loop.
Then i have updated the original record.json file.

In Purchasing products file - I have imported the record.json file
Used if else statement for if quantity required is in the record.json
Customer has purchased some quantity  of item in the availabale quantity,then the record.json file is updated.
Created a bill which prints name of the market,then asks for product id,quantity,customer name and phone number.Then prints price along with total billing amount for the product purchased.
Updated the record.json file.

In sales part created a dictonary called sales
Transition id gets updated when you run bill,enter the requirements,execute the updated code then the sales gets updated according to the requirements of the customer.
Then sales.json file is created
Totally it contains 4 files-Adding values,Purchasing products,record.json,sales.json.
